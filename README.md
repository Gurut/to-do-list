# to-do-list
This project includes a list of tasks to organize my GitHub repository

Hello there!

I am the owner of this repository. My name is Samet Tonyali. I got a PhD degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering earned at Florida International University, Miami, USA. Although I am unemployed now, I am expecting to get a position as a faculty member at a university in Turkey.

I have a lot of completed and ongoing software projects. This project is a to-do list of a bunch of tasks to organize and store these projects neatly in this repository.

Kindly regards,
Samet Tonyali
